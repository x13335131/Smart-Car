MOVEMENT SERVICE~
In the movement service you must turn on the engine to access other functions such as accelerate and slowdown.
you can also alter the speed limit by selecting a road you are driving on. For example if you are on a motorway 
you select motorway from the dropdown. By selecting this the car travels at a max speed of 120kph.
Once the Engine OFF button is selected, all other functions are disabled.

RADIO SERVICE~
Similar to the movement service, the radio needs to be turned on to access other radio functions. 
Other functions include searching back and forth through a selection of built in stations. 
The radio can be used as speakers for the phone.

PHONE SERVICE~ 
The phone service allows you to connect your phone to the car using bluetooth then selecting the connect option. 
Connecting your phone to the car allows you play your music through the radio speaker (if radio is turned on),
if radio (service) is not turned on or available, or if the phone isnt connected to the car, it'll play its mp3 
songs through its internal speakers. 

TEMPERATURE SERVICE~
This service allows you heat or cool the car. You may set your own max temperature by using 
the increase and decrease buttons and then clicking the confirm button.
